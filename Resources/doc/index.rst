Vespolina ProductBundle

General Concepts
================

The Product class is a container for basic product information. This includes product features, product options and
identifiers, such as SKUs, UPC, EAN or ASIN.

The minimal data needed for a Product is a name and product type.

Product Types
-------------

These are valid types of products
* Product::PHYSICAL
* Product::UNIQUE
* Product::DOWNLOAD
* Product::TIME
* Product::SERVICE

*Product::PHYSICAL*

*Product::UNIQUE*

*Product::DOWNLOAD*

*Product::TIME*

*Product::SERVICE*

Extending a Product
===================

The simpliest way to extend the ProductBundle is to use SonataEazyExtendsBundle. When you have it installed then
the following command will build out the Documents for you.

    ``app/console sonata:easy-extends:generate -d src VespolinaProductBundle``
